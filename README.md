# PickASlice
## Select one of six slicers on your system

I have this set up for my system (win 11) and the six 3d print slicers I have.  I've picked up coding for the first time since DOS and Turbo Pascal, so this is not exactly a magnum opus.
As this is version 1.0 - it's simple and straight forward.  "Settings" walks you thru selecting where your various slicers are and save that off.  One and done.

After that it's a simple matter of clicking the button to launch the specific slicer.

I have ideas for more updates in the future, but I'm still learning to drive Visual Studio.
